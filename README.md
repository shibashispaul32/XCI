The wave_pinning_1d directory contains more than one .in files each corresponding to different scenarios. To run the codes successfully one needs to change the name of the input file to input.in and run the code to get the simulation result for that scenario. 

The fortran codes require a fortran compiler to be installed in the system. We prefer using intel fortran compiler which is available free of cost.
